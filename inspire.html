            <h2>Temple Grandin: Turning Challenges into Strengths</h2>
            <p>Temple Grandin is one of the most inspiring figures—not just because she’s a brilliant animal scientist, but because she turned her challenges into strengths. When she was a child, she was diagnosed with autism at a time when people didn’t understand it well, and many assumed she wouldn’t be able to live a normal life. But she proved everyone wrong.</p>
            <p>Instead of relying on words like most people, she visualized the world in her mind with incredible detail, allowing her to notice things others overlooked. This ability gave her deep insight into animal behavior, which later helped her design innovative systems to reduce stress for livestock in farms.</p>
            <p>She also created the "Hug Machine"—a therapeutic tool that helps autistic individuals regulate their sensory experiences. Temple Grandin’s story teaches us that embracing uniqueness can lead to remarkable achievements.</p>

            <h2>Daniel Tammet: The Genius with an Extraordinary Mind</h2>
            <p>Daniel Tammet is an exceptional individual in every sense. Born in 1979 in Britain, he was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome. From childhood, Daniel showed a remarkable talent for numbers and languages.</p>
            <p>In 2004, he set a world record by reciting 22,514 digits of π (pi) from memory in just five hours. He speaks more than ten languages, including Icelandic, which he learned in just one week!</p>
            <p>Daniel perceives numbers as patterns, colors, and shapes, a condition known as synesthesia. His book, "Born on a Blue Day," shares his incredible life story, proving that autism is not a limitation but a unique way of experiencing the world.</p>
